# Alt Enter Fix
A simple program designed revert alt-enter presses to the old behavior. The manual version of this requires weekly navigation to the localappdata folder, finding the new roblox version, and pasting in a ClientSettings folder with a ClientAppSettings.json file. This program does this all automatically. Just run the program after every update, and it does the rest for you
